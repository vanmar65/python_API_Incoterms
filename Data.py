# All the texts concerning Incoterms

I_Intro = """The Incoterms or International Commercial Terms are a series of pre-defined commercial terms published 
by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) relating to international commercial law.[1] Incoterms define the 
responsibilities of exporters and importers in the arrangement of shipments and the transfer of liability involved at 
various stages of the transaction. They are widely used in international commercial transactions or procurement 
processes and their use is encouraged by trade councils, courts and international lawyers.[2] A series of 
three-letter trade terms related to common contractual sales practices, the Incoterms rules are intended primarily to 
clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks associated with the global or international transportation and 
delivery of goods. Incoterms inform sales contracts defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the 
delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer, but they do not themselves conclude a contract, determine the price 
payable, currency or credit terms, govern contract law or define where title to goods transfers The Incoterms rules 
are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of most commonly 
used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove altogether uncertainties arising from the 
differing interpretations of the rules in different countries. As such they are regularly incorporated into sales 
contracts worldwide.[3] 'Incoterms' is a registered trademark of the ICC.The first work published by the ICC on 
international trade terms was issued in 1923, with the first edition known as Incoterms published in 1936. The 
Incoterms rules were amended in 1953,[4] 1967, 1976, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, with the ninth version — Incoterms 
2020 [5] — having been published on September 10, 2019."""


I_FCA = """FCA – Free Carrier (named place of delivery) The seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, at a named 
place (possibly including seller's own premises). The goods can be delivered to a carrier nominated by the buyer, 
or to another party nominated by the buyer. In many respects this Incoterm has replaced FOB in modern usage, 
although the critical point at which the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place. The 
chosen place of delivery affects the obligations of loading and unloading the goods at that place. If delivery occurs 
at the seller's premises, or at any other location that is under the seller's control, the seller is responsible for 
loading the goods on to the buyer's carrier. However, if delivery occurs at any other place, the seller is deemed to 
have delivered the goods once their transport has arrived at the named place; the buyer is responsible for both 
unloading the goods and loading them onto their own carrier."""

I_EXW = """EXW – Ex Works (named place of delivery) The seller makes the goods available at their premises, 
or at another named place. This term places the maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the 
seller. The Ex Works term is often used while making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs 
included. EXW means that a buyer incurs the risks of bringing the goods to their final destination. Either the seller 
does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export, or if the seller does load the 
goods, they do so at buyer('s risk and cost. If the parties agree that the seller should be responsible for the 
loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made clear by 
adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.) There is no obligation for the seller to make a 
contract of carriage, but there is also no obligation for the buyer to arrange one either - the buyer may sell the 
goods on to their own customer for collection from the original seller's warehouse. However, in common practice the 
buyer arranges the collection of the freight from the designated location, and is responsible for clearing the goods 
through Customs. The buyer is also responsible for completing all the export documentation, although the seller does 
have an obligation to obtain information and documents at the buyer's request and cost. These documentary 
requirements may result in two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export 
declaration can be an issue in certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations 
require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. If the buyer is 
based outside of the customs jurisdiction, they will be unable to clear the goods for export, meaning that the goods 
may be declared in the name of the seller by the buyer, even though the export formalities are the buyer's 
responsibility under the EXW term.[13] Secondly, most jurisdictions require companies to provide proof of export for 
tax purposes. In an EXW shipment, the buyer is under no obligation to provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to 
even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a 
sales tax bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these 
matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA 
seller's premises, may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, 
which provides for more control over the export process."""

I_CPT = """CPT – Carriage Paid To (named place of destination) CPT replaces the C&F (cost and freight) and CFR terms 
for all shipping modes outside of non-containerized sea-freight. The seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to 
the named place of destination. However, the goods are considered to be delivered when the goods have been handed 
over to the first or main carrier, so that the risk transfers to buyer upon handing goods over to that carrier at the 
place of shipment in the country of Export. The seller is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and 
freight costs for carriage to the named place of destination (either the final destination such as the buyer's 
facilities or a port of destination. This has to be agreed to by seller and buyer, however). If the buyer requires 
the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIP should be considered instead."""

I_CIP = """CIP – Carriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination) This term is broadly similar to the 
above CPT term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. 
CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the 
Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses 
(C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same 
currency as the contract, and should allow the buyer, the seller, and anyone else with an insurable interest in the 
goods to be able to make a claim. CIP can be used for all modes of transport, whereas the Incoterm CIF should only be 
used for non-containerized sea-freight."""

I_DPU = """DPU – Delivered At Place Unloaded (named place of destination) This Incoterm requires that the seller 
delivers the goods, unloaded, at the named place of destination. The seller covers all the costs of transport (export 
fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk 
until arrival at the destination port or terminal. The terminal can be a port, airport, or inland freight 
interchange, but must be a facility with the capability to receive the shipment. If the seller is not able to 
organize unloading, they should consider shipping under DAP terms instead. All charges after unloading (for example, 
import duty, taxes, customs and on-carriage) are to be borne by buyer. However, it is important to note that any 
delay or demurrage charges at the terminal will generally be for the seller's account. Some uncertainty has emerged 
since Incoterms 2020 were adopted as to the meaning of "unloaded" when goods are delivered in a container, 
usually by sea, as the removal of the container from the incoming vessel may suggest that it has been "unloaded", 
but the goods themselves are not yet "unloaded" while they remain in the container."""

I_DAP = """DAP – Delivered At Place (named place of destination) Incoterms 2010 defines DAP as 'Delivered at Place' – 
the seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready 
for unloading at the named place of destination. Under DAP terms, the risk passes from seller to buyer from the point 
of destination mentioned in the contract of delivery. Once goods are ready for shipment, the necessary packing is 
carried out by the seller at their own cost, so that the goods reach their final destination safely. All necessary 
legal formalities in the exporting country are completed by the seller at their own cost and risk to clear the goods 
for export. After arrival of the goods in the country of destination, the customs clearance in the importing country 
needs to be completed by the buyer, e.g. import permit, documents required by customs, etc., including all customs 
duties and taxes. Under DAP terms, all carriage expenses with any terminal expenses are paid by seller up to the 
agreed destination point. The necessary unloading cost at final destination has to be borne by buyer under DAP terms."""

I_DDP = """DDP – Delivered Duty Paid (named place of destination) Seller is responsible for delivering the goods to 
the named place in the country of the buyer, and pays all costs in bringing the goods to the destination including 
import duties and taxes. The seller is not responsible for unloading. This term is often used in place of the 
non-Incoterm "Free In Store (FIS)". This term places the maximum obligations on the seller and minimum obligations on 
the buyer. No risk or responsibility is transferred to the buyer until delivery of the goods at the named place of 
destination.[18] The most important consideration for DDP terms is that the seller is responsible for clearing the 
goods through customs in the buyer's country, including both paying the duties and taxes, and obtaining the necessary 
authorizations and registrations from the authorities in that country. Unless the rules and regulations in the 
buyer's country are very well understood, DDP terms can be a very big risk both in terms of delays and in unforeseen 
extra costs, and should be used with caution."""
